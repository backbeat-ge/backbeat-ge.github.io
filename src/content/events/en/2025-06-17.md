Backbeat invites you to a special evening close to our hearts on Tuesday, June 17th at CafÃ© Gavroche (basement) from 6:30 PM to 11 PM with a special guest from New York!

We are delighted to welcome Odysseus Bailer, who is an African American Lindy Hop and Blues dancer, as well as an instructor and cultural speaker from New York. Odysseus has been actively dancing Lindy Hop and Blues for over 20 years.

Odysseus will give a lecture in English from 6:30 PM to 7:30 PM (with a discussion session from 7:30 PM to 8 PM) entitled: "To understand how Lindy Hop and Blues are connected to African American culture, it's important to know the history and journey of its people". His presentation slides will be translated into French for better accessibility.

Then, Odysseus will teach an all-levels Blues dance class from 8 PM to 9 PM.

The lecture and Blues class don't have a fixed price to allow access to as many people as possible, but we invite you to make a free and conscious donation according to your means (with a suggested price of 10 CHF for the lecture and 10 CHF for the class).

Starting at 9 PM, we'll enjoy a Blues social dance with Odysseus as DJ for the first hour. Come discover Blues dances and music if you don't know them yet! The evening will continue until 11 PM. See you on the 17th and spread the word! ðŸ¤©ðŸ¥°
