We are super excited to welcome Nathan & AnaÃ¯s for our next workshop on February 15-16.

## The Menu

Lindy - 3 levels:

* Beginner (for people who have never danced or have only taken a few classes)
* Intermediate (between a few months and a few years depending on involvement)
* Advanced (for all the enthusiasts ðŸ˜Š)

Solo - 2 levels:

* Relax
* Challenge

There aren't many levels so there will be some heterogeneity... that's okay. We're mainly here to enjoy exploring our dance together!

## The Formula

Full pass (6h of dance): 3h30 of lindy, 1h15 of solo jazz, 1h15 of solo blues

* Modest income (approx. \<4000): CHF 90
* Other income: CHF 120

Solo pass (2h30 of dance): 1h15 of solo jazz, 1h15 of solo blues

* Modest income (approx. \<4000): CHF 35
* Other income: CHF 45

If you're registering as a couple, we would really appreciate if you could fill out one form per person. It makes our task so much easier... THANK YOU VERY MUCH! :)
