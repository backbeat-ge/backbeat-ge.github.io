We are super excited to welcome for this special 10-year anniversary workshop of the Backbeat association, our dear María and Aurélien, who, for many of us, guided our first triple steps and swing outs! We'll have the chance to take solo jazz and lindy hop classes with them!

Come swing with us and reminisce about those crazy and sweaty workshops at Jaques Dalcroze. And if you don't know about it yet, we're really looking forward to sharing this with you!

More information coming soon about the rest of the weekend festivities!
