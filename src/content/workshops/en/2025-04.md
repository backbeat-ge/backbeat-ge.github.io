Here is the detailed schedule for the April 5-6 workshop with our guest teachers: Viktor and Vassiliki.

## The Program

Classes will take place at Institut Jaques Dalcroze as usual. There will be three levels of lindy hop (beginner/intermediate; intermediate; advanced), two levels of solo jazz classes, and also an R&B/Soul line dances class with Viktor! ðŸ”¥

There won't be any lindy hop initiation/beginner level during this workshop and the level descriptions have slightly changed, so please read them carefully before registering ðŸ¤“. You can choose either the full pass including 3h of Lindy Hop and 3h of solo jazz, or just a solo jazz pass.

### The Party ðŸª©

The social dance party will take place at the Pickwick from 9:00 PM to 11:30 PM!! We'll have the pleasure of having Viktor as guest DJ at the decks for part of the evening (with probably some R&B/Line dances moments so don't miss it!).

The party will be preceded by a discussion about swing jazz music and its history ðŸŽº from 9:00 PM to 9:30 PM, to learn more about the music we love dancing to so much!! Don't miss it ðŸŽ¶

## The Levels

Lindy Hop - 3 levels: Please read the level descriptions carefully as they have changed. To ensure everyone is comfortable in class in terms of learning, please choose the level that matches your experience according to the following descriptions :)

- **Beginner/Intermediate**: You've been dancing for 1-2 years. Open to everyone who is comfortable with swing out, circle, and basic 6-count vocabulary. Content will be adapted to all levels!
- **Intermediate/Advanced**: You've been dancing for 2-4 years and practice regularly. You have several years of Lindy Hop experience and regularly attend socials. You're comfortable with syncopated rhythms (triple steps) and kicks. You want to approach dance from a different angle and aren't afraid to tackle multiple new contents in one class (new rhythms, vocabulary, concepts...).
- **Advanced**: You've been dancing for more than 4 years, practice regularly, and attend workshops. You're very comfortable with syncopated rhythms and kicks, you also have good Solo foundations and as indicated: you want a dose of challenge for this workshop!

Solo - 2 levels:

- **Relax**: Open to people who want a relaxed learning pace.
- **Challenge**: You want a dose of challenge and aren't afraid to participate in jams or learn new complex combos!
