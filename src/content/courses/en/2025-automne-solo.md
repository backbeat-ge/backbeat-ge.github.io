## Solo Jazz

We're super excited to offer you a beginner Solo Jazz class! Solo Jazz is an African-American dance style that allows you to explore movement on your own while still connecting with the group.

Come and discover the fundamentals of this dance with Magali: the connection to swing music, rhythm, basic movements to help you create your own style, and express yourself through dance!

### Dates and Times

The Solo Jazz classes will take place from Wednesday, October 1st to Wednesday, December 17th at the École des Grottes (no classes during school holidays).

* Time: 6 PM – 7 PM

Price: 190.- (full price)* / 125.- (reduced price)**

(*) The full price is intended for people working in Switzerland with an average or above-average income (as a rough guideline: a gross monthly salary over 4,500 CHF. Other factors like family income or wealth also count — we leave the details up to you). It's also intended for those working outside Switzerland who are in a good financial situation (approx. gross salary over 3,000 euros/month).

(**) The reduced price is intended for people working outside Switzerland, or for those working in Switzerland with lower incomes.

### Info

Classes will be held weekly, except during the school holidays from October 20 to October 26.
