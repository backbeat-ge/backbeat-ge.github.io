## Lindy Hop

Backbeat offers you an amazing **beginner Lindy Hop** class!

A beginner class in ELEF mode (Everybody Leads, Everybody Follows), led by a highly motivated team eager to explore this approach.

* ELEF mode is liberating: it helps prevent your gender from limiting your personality as a dancer.
* ELEF mode is social: it puts meeting and connecting with your partners at the heart of the dance!
* ELEF mode is freeing from pressure: by switching roles, we make mistakes, we realize the challenges on both sides of partner dancing, we laugh at our errors, we empathize, and take big steps toward a practice where, quite simply, we express ourselves.

This class is designed for beginners and aims to gradually introduce the basic rhythms and figures of Lindy Hop in both roles. It also seeks to share key elements of the history and culture of African American dances from the Swing Era.

The Backbeat association is committed to creating an inclusive atmosphere in this class, a space where everyone feels safe and confident. No form of discrimination will be tolerated—whether racism, classism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, or other forms of discrimination, whether explicit or implicit. In cases where discriminatory acts are committed, the association reserves the right to exclude the person with immediate effect and without refund.

### Dates & Times

Lindy Hop classes take place from **Tuesday, October 28, 2025 to February 17, 2026** at **École Hugo de Senger** in Plainpalais.

* Schedule: 8:15 PM – 9:30 PM

Classes will be held weekly, except during school holidays:

* Weeks of December 22 to January 2.

### Price

Price: CHF 240 (full price)* / CHF 160 (reduced price)**

(*) The full price is intended for people working in Switzerland with an economic situation roughly at the national average (as a rough indicator: a gross monthly salary above CHF 4,500). Other factors should of course be taken into account—family resources, assets, etc.—we leave that to your judgment. It is also intended for those working outside Switzerland with a good economic situation (approximate indicator: gross salary above €3,000 per month).

(**) The reduced price is intended for people working outside Switzerland, and for those working in Switzerland with lower incomes.
