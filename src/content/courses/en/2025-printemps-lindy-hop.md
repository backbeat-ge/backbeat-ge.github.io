## Lindy Hop

We're offering an awesome Lindy Hop class!!

An intermediate class in ELEF mode (everybody leads, everybody follows), led by a team super motivated to explore this modality.

- ELEF modality is liberating: it helps you avoid having your gender limit your personality as a dancer.
- ELEF modality is social: it puts the connection between partners at the center!
- ELEF modality is freeing: by switching roles, we make mistakes, we realize the challenges on both sides of partner dancing, we laugh at our mistakes, we empathize and take big steps toward a practice where, simply put, we express ourselves.

The class is designed for people who have already completed about 1 year of ELEF classes OR at least 1 year of classes in a single role and have the basics to dance the following moves with some variations in both roles:

- Charleston: hand-to-hand, tandem entrance ("chase"), airplane
- Lindy Hop 6 counts: send out, change position, tuck turn
- Lindy Hop 8 counts: circle, swing out
