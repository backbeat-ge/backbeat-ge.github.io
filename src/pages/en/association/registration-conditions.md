# Registration Conditions

By paying for your workshop registration, you agree to the following conditions, rules, and procedures.

## Respect and Etiquette

We want everyone to feel comfortable in our workshops. Showing respect and being courteous to other participants is a minimum standard. We do not tolerate any sexist or racist behavior, or any behavior that goes against the integrity and dignity of others. We reserve the right to immediately exclude and provide no refund to anyone who violates this rule. Furthermore, we reserve the right to refuse anyone who has engaged in reprehensible behavior that may harm one or more participants, even outside of our workshops. If you believe you have been a victim or witness of such behavior, we encourage you to speak to us. This rule applies to all activities organized by backbeat.

## Registration with and without a partner

We accept registrations on a first-come, first-served basis. Registrations with a partner are accepted directly until the limit of available spots (please note that each person must fill out a separate form).

It is possible to register without a partner. However, if no partner is immediately available, individuals are placed on a waiting list based on the order of registration until a partner can be assigned to them. We usually find a solution, but confirmations may come late. We appreciate your patience.

It is possible to indicate an already registered and waitlisted person as a partner so that they can be accepted. However, it is not possible to indicate an already registered partner to avoid being on the waiting list, even if that person is registered without a partner.

Individuals registered without a partner cannot add one after their registration.

During the classes, we regularly change partners. You will not stay with the same partner throughout the entire class.

## In case of absence

Once paid, the registration is final and non-refundable. Individuals who announce and justify their absence for imperative reasons can request to postpone their participation to a future workshop. Once the request is accepted, they must re-register normally for the desired date. If the class is full, the postponement is further delayed to a later date. The postponement cannot be claimed more than one year after the missed workshop.

Registrations are personal and non-transferable.

## Level

At each workshop, participants are divided into 6 groups. In order to guarantee the best possible learning conditions, here is what you need to do:

Fill out the registration form indicating your level (from Beginner to Advanced). We will assign you to the group that we think is appropriate based on what we know about your dance skills, the information you provide, and the people who register for the workshop.
In the email confirming your pre-registration, you will receive the name of the group you are assigned to.
Depending on the availability of spots and the leader-follower balance, it is possible for you to attend a lower-level class than the one we propose. Just let us know so that we can ensure that there is a free spot.
If you want to attend a higher-level class than the one we propose, write to us and we will discuss it.

From our point of view, the homogeneity of a group depends, among other things, on the common background of the participants. Therefore, we try to keep together people who have already attended many workshops. Additionally, we have to pay special attention to the balance between leaders and followers. For these two reasons, it is possible that you dance as well (or even better) than some people in the level above yours. However, we believe that the group we propose will be enriching for you. If, however, you find the content of the class or the given advice too basic, or if you feel that you have a higher level than most people in the group above yours, you are probably not in the right group. In that case, please let us know as soon as possible!

## Instructors

We do our best to provide you with quality instructors. At each workshop, we have a couple of invited instructors, usually announced on our Facebook page. Unfortunately, these instructors cannot teach all the groups. Furthermore, although it has never happened before, we cannot exclude the possibility that they may be unable to teach or travel to Geneva. For this reason, announcements regarding instructors are not contractually binding, and they may be replaced without notice and without entitling you to a refund. However, in the highly unlikely event that we have to cancel a class, we will either provide a replacement or offer a full refund for the workshop, proportional to the missed hours.

## "Taxi"

Any registered person can also request to be a "taxi" for a less advanced level than their own, free of charge, including for a different role. Followers, we warmly invite you to learn how to lead (as we usually lack leaders). By its principle, this possibility is not offered to beginners (Artie group). Most of the time, it is also not offered to the Billie and Count groups because the Artie, Billie, and Count classes take place at the same time. However, we ask taxis to honor their commitment. This possibility is obviously only offered in case of an imbalance in the groups. It cannot be claimed as a right.

## Attire

We are fortunate to gather in exceptional venues. For this reason, only white-soled and clean shoes are allowed. Otherwise, the workshop must be attended in socks. As for the rest, we will stretch, jump, and sweat. Therefore, we recommend comfortable, flexible, and breathable clothing.

### The other participants thank you

Lindy Hop is a social dance where we are in contact with each other. Therefore, we ask you to make it enjoyable to dance with you as much as possible. In particular, since you will likely sweat a lot, feel free to bring a change of clothes.

### Recommendations to observe during class

We ask you not to tell other participants what they should do or how they should do it, or that they are not performing an exercise or movement correctly unless they explicitly ask you to. However, we encourage you to give feedback to your partners based on what you feel. So, feel free to let your partners know if the movements you are doing together are pleasant or unpleasant.

All workshop participants are here to learn. Do not expect them to know how to perform the movements we teach. It is normal for you to have difficulties with certain exercises. The same goes for your partners.

The dynamics of a group are as important as they are fragile. Therefore, do not hesitate to encourage your partners, especially when they are struggling. A smile, a kind word, or words of encouragement help maintain the motivation and good mood of the entire group.
